Before that, he was a (Boya) Postdoctoral Researcher in National Institute of Health Data Science at Peking University working with Prof. Luxia Zhang from Sep. 2020 to Jul. 2022, a Postdoctoral Researcher at Georgia Institute of Technology working with Prof. Jimeng Sun from Sep. 2019 to Aug. 2020, a Visiting Researcher at Harvard Medical School working with Prof. M. Brandon Westover from Feb. 2020 to Aug. 2020. He obtained his Ph.D. degree from Peking University under the supervision of Prof. Hongyan Li in 2019, and B.S. degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2014.\nHis research interests are data mining and artificial intelligence for real-world healthcare data, especially deep learning for temporal medical data \u0026ndash; such as temporal events, time series (e.g. longitudinal data, electronic health records, claims data), and physiological signals (e.g. electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, polysomnogram, heart rates). He serves as an associate editor of Health Data Science - a Science Partner Journal, a program committee member or reviewer for international conferences including KDD, ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI and IJCAI. He also led a team that won the first place of the 18th PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge .\nNEW! We are recruiting PostDoc  [link]  , Ph.D. (fall 2024)  [link]  , and Interns  [link]  who have a strong passion for health data science with coding skills.
